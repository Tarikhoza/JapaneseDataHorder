# JapaneseDataHorder
Data-scraper for various japanese learning tools(Takoboto, Tatoeba, Ichimoe and OJAD)

A collection of web scraping modules written, to collect data for the UltimateJLPTDeck.
The collection consists of four modules:
  ## Takoboto
    To get the vocabulary lists from the website
  ## Tatoeba
    To download the sentence pair tsv from the website
  ## Ichimoe
    For the sentence deconstruction feature
  ## OJAD
    For the Suzuki-kun pitch accent audio and graph generartor
    
There are also other features on the websites that I didn't implement in my scripts. If there is a need it is possible to implement. But I didn't need them so I didn't implement them. Please if you use these scripts, please have in mind that it might create a lot of stress on the websites, so be mindful about what you do. Please use the data according the licences of the websites downloaded from.
