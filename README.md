# JapaneseDataHorder
Data-scraper for various japanese learning tools(Takoboto, Tatoeba, Ichimoe and OJAD)

A collection of web scraping modules I wrote, to collect data for my needs.
The collection consists of four modules:
  ## Takoboto -
    To get the vocabulary lists from the website
  ## Tatoeba - 
    To download the sentence pair tsv from the website
  ## Ichimoe -
    For the sentence deconstruction feature
  ## OJAD -
    For the Suzuki-kun pitch accent audio and graph generartor
    
There are also other features on the websites that I didn't implement in my scripts. If there is a need it is possible to implement. But I didn't need them so I didn't implement dhem.
